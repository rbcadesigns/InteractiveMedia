    <h2>Hunt n' Gather #1</h2>
        <p>
            Tasked with finding & documenting 3 examples of noteworthy WEB-PAGES or WEB-APPS. 
            Whether they be hyperlinked stories, service, artworks, portfolios, brand websites, 
            interactive or immersive spaces, here are my findings
        </p>

<h3>
    The Goonies Website
</h3>
  <p>
    I thought the Goonies Website was notable because of the
    immersive storytelling experience created from the initial 
    homepage that moves inwards into the grid as users scroll.
    This inward scroll subverts the conventional use of the scroll
    gesture from 'up and down' to 'zoom in and out'.

<h3>
    Falling falling
</h3>
<p>
    I chose the Falling Falling website because its purpose is ambiguous to visitors
    because it creates relaxing, almost hypnotic visuals but when visitors click the
    falling visuals it produces an earry sound as they collapse.
    The website feels like an art experience.

<h3>
    Cleverswim
</h3>
<p>
    Cleverswim is a playful website that I found notable for the cohesive creation
    of the website theme, a swimming pool environment.
    The playful and childish nature of the website is created through the moving background
    of swimming pool water and the animated pool accessories with googly eyes - reminiscent
    of a children's television show.
    The website is in German and aims to educate and inform visitors on the swim school.

    <h2>LOOK!</h2>
        <p>
            This activity asked us to describe the different types of works we found
            within 'The Useless Web', a random generator for useless websites, including
            the interactive elements and how/what they are used for.

            <td>
                <p>
                    The Home page contains one simple pink button labeled “PLEASE” that
                     acts as a call to action to visitors. However, this landing page 
                     also contains a footer that contains links that give visitors the 
                     option to read more about the featured websites, the creator of the 
                     project, option to submit websites and legal information.

    <!--Featured website #1: Long Doge Challenge Embed-->
    <h3>
        Featured useless website #1: Long Doge Challenge 
    </h3>
    <p>
        Visitors can increase the number of collected ‘wows’ by scrolling down 
        the page, which also changes the description of the dog’s length.
        Visitors are also given the option to print their Long Doge.
        The website is fairly minimalist in functionality, the color palette is 
        primarily in tones of black and white, additionally there are 5 buttons 
        for visitors to click; three of which are linked to sharing and viewing on 
        social media, whilst the other two are for information or printing.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Featured useless website #2: Sliding Toys
    </h3>
    <p>
        Visitors can play variations of the sliding toy game which involves sliding 
        the numbered tiles on the 3x3 display. When a visitor slides a numbered tile 
        into its correct position, the outline changes from black to blue.
        Aside from the tiles, users can also click buttons like ‘SLIDING TOYS’ and ‘RESET’. 
        The website design is again, minimalistic in the red, white and blue color palette. 
        The font choice also contributes to giving the website a retro game experience.
        The game keeps track of the visitor’s ‘MOVES’ and ‘TIME’ taken to complete the sliding 
        game.
        Once a visitor has completed a challenge, digital confetti rains down the screen, 
        providing the user with the option to play another game at the same level or try a 
        bigger challenge.

    <h3>
        Featured useless website #3: Maze Toys
    </h3>
    <p>
        Similar to the <i>Sliding Toys website</i>, visitors can play variations of the maze 
        game which involves pressing empty spaces for the red line to enter to reach the tomato
        at the end of the maze.
        
        Visitors can undo their moves by simpling clicking backwards a space on the maze.
        Again, the game keeps track of the number of moves and time taken for the visitor to
        complete the maze.

        The website design is again, minimalistic in the red, white and black color palette.
