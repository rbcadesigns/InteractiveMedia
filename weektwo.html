    <h2>Hunt n' Gather #1</h2>
        <p>
            Tasked with finding & documenting 3 examples of noteworthy WEB-PAGES or WEB-APPS. 
            Whether they be hyperlinked stories, service, artworks, portfolios, brand websites, 
            interactive or immersive spaces, here are my findings
        </p>

<!--Embedding the notable website into my website-->
<h3>
    The Goonies Website
</h3>
  <p>
    I thought the Goonies Website was notable because of the
    immersive storytelling experience created from the initial 
    homepage that moves inwards into the grid as users scroll.
    This inward scroll subverts the conventional use of the scroll
    gesture from 'up and down' to 'zoom in and out'.

<h3>
    Falling falling
</h3>
<p>
    I chose the Falling Falling website because its purpose is ambiguous to visitors
    because it creates relaxing, almost hypnotic visuals but when visitors click the
    falling visuals it produces an earry sound as they collapse.
    The website feels like an art experience.

<h3>
    Cleverswim
</h3>
<p>
    Cleverswim is a playful website that I found notable for the cohesive creation
    of the website theme, a swimming pool environment.
    The playful and childish nature of the website is created through the moving background
    of swimming pool water and the animated pool accessories with googly eyes - reminiscent
    of a children's television show.
    The website is in German and aims to educate and inform visitors on the swim school.

    <h2>LOOK!</h2>
        <p>
            This activity asked us to describe the different types of works we found
            within 'The Useless Web', a random generator for useless websites, including
            the interactive elements and how/what they are used for.
