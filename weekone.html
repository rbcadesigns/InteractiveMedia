                Originally developed with and for musician Imogen Heap, the mi.mu gloves are a transformational new way to compose and perform music. For musicians, the gloves offer a radical new way to interact with computer music, allowing them to sculpt sound with their hands, or manipulate effects with their fingers.
                The Mi.Mu Gloves, were first shown at a TEDGlobal conference eight years ago. Imogen Heap not only has an enchanting voice but also the talents of a world-class audio engineer. She's completely engrossed in a technology she's helped to develop, one that makes it possible to alter sounds, create loops and compose 
                tunes all with the wave of her glove-wearing hands. Her performances, with her sound-altering arm and hand gestures, resemble a summoning of spirits, a far more compelling live experience than what Imogen said used to look like she was standing behind her laptop checking email.

            AI skin diagnosis product LUMINI, which can perform the whole process of analyzing skin, making a diagnosis and recommending ideal cosmetics, all in the short space of around 10 seconds.
            LUMINI is basically made up of three elements: a device (hardware) that acquires the skin data, an AI algorithm (software) that analyzes that data, and a data managing system that visualizes the acquired data onscreen.
            LUMINI's strength lies in the accuracy of its data collecting, that involves scanning the condition of the skin down to its deeper layers, and its advanced powers of analysis.
            Its accuracy allows for results equivalent to diagnoses clinical experts perform with the naked eye. Along with this, LUMINI also excels at providing consistent analysis results even under varying environmental factors, such as the light brightness, temperature or humidity in a room.

            <p>
                <u>What is this for?</u>
                Simple hand/arm gestures like waving them down are under-exploited 
                when it comes to technology that is used at home. For example, waving 
                a hand down to close a garage door would be more convenient than taking 
                out a garage door opener device.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>How does it work?</u>
                Eye tracking software could be downloaded into the camera of a device to 
                track the user's eye movement; where the user's eyes linger on a certain 
                screen the phone would stop scrolling and if the user looks at a certain 
                icon like the comments, then the comments can open up.

            <p><strong>Eye tracking</strong></p>

                Although eye tracking is currently used in studies, the gestures of the 
                eye could also be utilized to improve accessibility for those with 
                disabilities/impairments, or to just improve the browsing experience for 
                users without having to touch the device.

                Utilizing the gesture of certain dance cues to activate specific light and 
                sound production in stage productions could enhance the preparation and 
                effectiveness of performances.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>How does it work?</u>
                Gesture motion sensors around the stage and the back of the theater would 
                accurately detect the gesture of the performer/s, activating the lighting 
                and audio to match the next movements.
