    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <p><i>
        This week we explored web archives of interesting works,
        critically looked at commercial websites and workshopped fluid design
        into our websites using @media queries.
    </i></p>

<div hg>
    <h2>Hunt n' Gather #1</h2>
        <p>
            Find & document (with a reference & one sentence & 1 image) 
            3 x examples of interesting / engaging / quirky / unique / or 
            otherwise noteworthy WEB ARCHIVES or GALLERIES OF WORKS. 
            How are large collections organised?
        </p>

<h3>
    The Goonies Website
</h3>
  <p>
    I thought the Goonies Website was notable because of the
    immersive storytelling experience created from the initial 
    homepage that moves inwards into the grid as users scroll.
    This inward scroll subverts the conventional use of the scroll
    gesture from 'up and down' to 'zoom in and out'.

<h3>
    Falling falling
</h3>
<p>
    I chose the Falling Falling website because its purpose is ambiguous to visitors
    because it creates relaxing, almost hypnotic visuals but when visitors click the
    falling visuals it produces an earry sound as they collapse.
    The website feels like an art experience.

<h3>
    Cleverswim
</h3>
<p>
    Cleverswim is a playful website that I found notable for the cohesive creation
    of the website theme, a swimming pool environment.
    The playful and childish nature of the website is created through the moving background
    of swimming pool water and the animated pool accessories with googly eyes - reminiscent
    of a children's television show.
    The website is in German and aims to educate and inform visitors on the swim school.

    <h2>LOOK!</h2>
        <p>
            Access and look critically at one of the following commercial sites.
            Describe the overall structure. Using developer tools find out the exact 
            color palette used, list the Headline and body font (s).
            List the interactive elements such as buttons, cursor control, sound, colour, 
            animation, or style change (what, what for and how do they work)

        <tr>
            <th>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>
                    The Home page contains one simple pink button labeled “PLEASE” that
                     acts as a call to action to visitors. However, this landing page 
                     also contains a footer that contains links that give visitors the 
                     option to read more about the featured websites, the creator of the 
                     project, option to submit websites and legal information.
